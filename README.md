# Hey, I'm Mitch! 👋

I currently work as a NOC Analyst at a relatively large MSP here in New Zealand, with a passion for Cybersecurity, specifically GRC. \
The purpose of this Github is to document my journey of levelling up as an IT Professional as well as develop skills to break into Cybersecurity. 

Hope you enjoy the content!
