# Hey, I'm Mitch! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a former Physiology student turned IT Professional, currently working as a NOC Analyst at a relatively large MSP here in New Zealand with a passion for Cybersecurity â€” specifically GRC.

The purpose of this Github is to document my journey of levelling up as an IT Professional as well as develop skills to break into Cybersecurity.

I plan on creating a new blog post everytime I cover a new piece of content, whether that'll be learning more about GRC or diving into Pen Testing via HTB or THM.

Feel free to connect!
